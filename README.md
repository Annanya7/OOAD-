# Object-Oriented Analysis
Object–Oriented Analysis (OOA) is the procedure of identifying software engineering requirements and developing software specifications in terms of a software system’s object model, which comprises of interacting objects.

The main difference between object-oriented analysis and other forms of analysis is that in object-oriented approach, requirements are organized around objects, which integrate both data and functions. They are modelled after real-world objects that the system interacts with. In traditional analysis methodologies, the two aspects - functions and data - are considered separately.

# Object-Oriented Design
Object–Oriented Design (OOD) involves implementation of the conceptual model produced during object-oriented analysis. In OOD, concepts in the analysis model, which are technology−independent, are mapped onto implementing classes, constraints are identified and interfaces are designed, resulting in a model for the solution domain, i.e., a detailed description of how the system is to be built on concrete technologies.

The implementation details generally include −
Restructuring the class data (if necessary),
Implementation of methods, i.e., internal data structures and algorithms,
Implementation of control, and
Implementation of associations.

# Object-Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based upon objects (having both data and methods) that aims to incorporate the advantages of modularity and reusability. Objects, which are usually instances of classes, are used to interact with one another to design applications and computer programs.

# USE CASE DIAGRAM 
Use case diagrams present an outside view of the manner the elements in a system behave and how they can be used in the context.
Use case diagrams comprise of −
1. Use cases
2. Actors
3. Relationships like dependency, generalization, and association

Use case diagrams are used −
1. To model the context of a system by enclosing all the activities of a system within a rectangle and focusing on the actors outside the system by interacting with it.
2. To model the requirements of a system from the outside point of view.
